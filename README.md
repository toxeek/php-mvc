php-mvc PoC

#### This is supposed to be a custom made php mvc with an uploader to upload files to a nagiossql instance. The format of the files to upload is a one column file separated by a new line, with a name of a cdn node, say na123 (north america 123). Main thing is that the structure is a very simple and quick mvc, the controller view interaction can be improved.
